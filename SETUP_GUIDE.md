# DQN CarRacing Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Install basic dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```

3. **Start training:**
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Dependencies
- Fixed PyTorch and torchvision installation
- Added missing packages: gymnasium, seaborn, pandas
- Made Box2D optional with fallback mock environment

### ✅ Environment Compatibility
- Added fallback to CarRacing-v1 if v2 not available
- Created mock environment for testing when CarRacing unavailable
- Fixed environment version warnings

### ✅ Code Issues
- Fixed array truth value ambiguity in analysis.py
- Fixed list/array checking in multiple files
- Added proper error handling for missing environments

### ✅ Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (test_setup.py)
- Added diagnostics for all major components
- Verified training pipeline works end-to-end

## CarRacing Environment (Optional)

The project works with a mock environment by default. To use the real CarRacing environment:

### macOS:
```bash
brew install swig
pip install box2d-py
```

### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install swig python3-dev
pip install box2d-py
```

### Automated Installation:
```bash
python install_carracing.py
```

## Project Status

✅ **Working Components:**
- DQN Agent with experience replay
- Training loop with logging
- Analysis and diagnostic tools
- Mock environment for testing
- Comprehensive test suite

⚠️ **Optional Components:**
- Real CarRacing environment (requires Box2D)
- GPU acceleration (works on CPU)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training:
```bash
python training.py
```

### Run Experiments:
```bash
python run_experiment.py --config baseline
python run_experiment.py --all  # Run all configurations
```

### Analyze Results:
```bash
python analysis.py
```

### Test Setup:
```bash
python test_setup.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'gymnasium'"
```bash
pip install gymnasium
```

### "No module named 'torch'"
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### "CarRacing environment not available"
This is expected if Box2D isn't installed. The project will use a mock environment that works for testing the DQN implementation.

### Box2D Installation Issues
Run the automated installer:
```bash
python install_carracing.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with mock environment:** The current setup works perfectly for testing DQN algorithms
2. **Install CarRacing (optional):** For real car racing, install Box2D dependencies
3. **Customize training:** Modify configs in training.py or run_experiment.py
4. **Analyze results:** Use analysis.py to diagnose training issues

The project is fully functional and ready for DQN experimentation!
